### Aim
The Aim of this study was to compare microRNA differential expression in fecal samples of children with viral and bacterial gastroenteritis.
I used Luminex xTAG device and kit for multiplex detection of pathogenic gastrointestinal bacteria and viruses.  
Sapovirus was detected using qPCR. 
### Method
Total RNA was extracted from samples and I used microarrays to measure condition-wise microRNA expression signal. Data was analyzed using  R. 
Objective 1: compare microRNA level between children with norovirus diarrhea Vs rotavirus diarrhea 
Objective 2: compare microRNA level between children with bacterial diarrhea Vs viral diarrhea.
